Project Description/ Outline
Today, Real Estate investment research is time consuming because the dispersed information
related to home value tendencies, school ratings, amount of transactions happening,etc.. per
subdivision in Houston. A manual query can easily take over 4 weeks of work. The following
project attempts to quickly respond to an investor with a ranking of Houston’s best subdivisions
to invest in, and/or an investment score for any given address.
Research Questions to Answer
- Are there discernible trends in home index values (over the last x years) that identify
some zip codes or subdivisions as more desirable for real estate investment in Houston?
- What are the home value trends in Houston by Zip Code/ Subdivision?
- Are there any correlations between home values and school ratings?
- What is the amount of sale transactions by Zip Code/ Subdivision?
We will add other criteria as time for the project permits:
- What is the crime rate per subdivision?
- What is the major flood zoning per sub-division?
- Are there restaurants, museums, public transit, universities nearby?
